# Quant SPA
SPA for Quantitative Finance
___________________________________________
An Ionic(Angular) SPA for Quantative Finance.
___________________________________________
Based on 'Practical Quantitative Finance With ASP.NET Core and Angular' by Dr. Xu.
It follows the same structure but uses Ionic to make the app available on mobile devices and includes unit tests.
If you look at / use this code I recommend you get the book to get an understanding of creating useful Quant Finance apps using Angular.
If you know another Frontend language you could just use that instead.
There are some differences but if you have the book you should be able to use this as an example for cross reference if you didn't want to write along.
